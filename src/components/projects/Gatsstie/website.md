brief: "The content on this page is generated automatically using Graphql and SQL!"

GraphQL is an alternative to REST, not SQL. GraphQL is not SQL! Instead, GraphQL is data-agonistic, and GraphQL, being one of the possible and most popular way, uses SQL to fetch data.

<h2> How My Sites Uses Graph QL </h2>

The Project and Blog section of my website are actually generated by Graph QL.  The list you see on each page is the result of an sql query and a little bit of Node JS.  Each of the items of these pages exsist as a simple markdown file with a few key fields included in the markdown header section that allow me to filter and sort different posts.

For example, the Project section of this website uses the following SQL query to ensure that the content on my page is only related to my project posts.

```
    const data= useStaticQuery(graphql`
{
  allMarkdownRemark(filter: {frontmatter: {type: {eq: "project"}}}) {
    edges {
      node {
        frontmatter {
          title
          date
          type
          brief
        }
        fields {
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
